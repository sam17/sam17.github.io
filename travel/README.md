# Travel

This is a simple visualization of the world map using HighCharts. It is a static page with no backend and the dark color represents the countries that I have visited. It allows one to zoom within US and India and highlights the visited states. As I have never lived longterm in any other country I didn't add the ability to zoom into them.

This was purely a fun project for me in trying to read more about data visualization and also thinking more about my future vacations.

# Future Ideas

- Convert into a webapp or embeddable widget
- Add more information using timelines and markers for cities that have been visited
